# Data structure

You need to store all symbol data and its description in a repository.
To do this, provide two directories and add your data files.

- Create a [JSON file](#symbolinfo-format) with symbol descriptions in the `symbol_info` directory.
- For each symbol, create a [CSV file](#data-format) with daily data in the `data/repo_name` directory.

## Data format

Each symbol and its daily data must be placed into a separate CSV file in the `data/repo_name` directory.
Daily data represents the symbol's OHLC (open-high-low-close) prices on charts.

> __Note__
>
> The EOD (End-of-Day) feed has a limit of 1,000 symbols per repository. Keep this in mind when adding data files.
> To connect more symbols, you can create another data repository.

Follow these requirements when creating a file:

- File names must be equal to symbol names, capitalized, and [URL encoded][url_encode].
- File extension must be `.csv`.
- Values must be comma-separated.
- Do not use headers, blank lines, and spaces.
- The lines of the file must be sorted by `date` in ascending order.
- The lines should not contain duplicates by `date`.  

| Field    | Description                                        | Sample      |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `date`   | Date in YYYYMMDDT format.                          | `20210101T` |
| `open`   | First tick price.                                  | `0.1`       |
| `high`   | Maximum tick price.                                | `0.1`       |
| `low`    | Minimum tick price.                                | `0.1`       |
| `close`  | Last tick price.                                   | `0.1`       |
| `volume` | Total number of shares traded. Cannot be negative. | `0.0`       |

> __Note__
>
> If your data series has a single value only, fill the `open`, `close`, `high`, and `low` fields with the same value and `volume` with `0`.

CSV file example:

```csv
20210101T,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0
```

### Data update

Your EOD data is checked and uploaded to the TradingView repository daily.
You can see the data for all previous days on the [chart][tv_chart].
The data checked and uploaded today will appear on the chart the next day.
If you don't update the data for three months, it will be removed from the TradingView storage.

Intraday data and real-time updates are possible using a REST protocol, but this option is only available for [brokerage integration][brokerage_integration].

## Symbol_info format

Symbol information must be placed into a single JSON file in the `symbol_info` directory.

Follow these requirements when creating a file:

- The file name must be equal to the repository name, and the extension must be `.json`.
- The file consists of a JSON object that cannot be empty.

The object consists of the following required fields:

| Field | Type | Description | Note |
|-|-|-|-|
| `symbol` | String | Symbol name used in TradingView. | Cannot be empty. Validation rule: `^[A-Z0-9._]+$`. |
| `currency` | String | Three-letter currency code according to [ISO 4217][iso_4217]. | Can be empty. Validation rule: `^[A-Z0-9._]+$`. |
| `description` | String | Symbol description. | Cannot be empty. |
| `pricescale` | Integer | Indicates how many decimal places the price has. | The value format is `10^n`, where *n* is the number of decimal places. For example, if the price has two decimal places `300.01`, set `pricescale` to `100`. If it has three decimal places `300.001`, set `pricescale` to `1000`, etc. If the price doesn't have decimals, set `pricescale` to `1`. |

> __Note__
> 
> Each object field is an array with values.
> For all fields, the length of these arrays must match.
> However, if all the values in the array are the same, you can specify a single value for the field instead of an array.

Consider the following example.
If you specify three symbols in the object, 
then you also need to specify three descriptions, three price scales, and three currencies (which can be empty) for each symbol.

```json
{
   "symbol": [
      "BTC_DEV_ACTIVITY",
      "BTC_SOCIAL_VOLUME_TOTAL",
      "ETH_DEV_ACTIVITY"
   ],
   "pricescale": [10, 10, 10],
   "currency": "",
   "description": [
      "Bitcoin developer activity",
      "Bitcoin social volume total",
      "Ethereum developer activity"
   ]
}
```

However, if all added symbols have the same price scale, you can only specify a single value in the `pricescale` field:
`"pricescale": 10` instead of `"pricescale": [10, 10, 10]`.

```json
{
   "symbol": [
      "BTC_DEV_ACTIVITY",
      "BTC_SOCIAL_VOLUME_TOTAL",
      "ETH_DEV_ACTIVITY"
   ],
   "pricescale": 10,
   "currency": "",
   "description": [
      "Bitcoin developer activity",
      "Bitcoin social volume total",
      "Ethereum developer activity"
   ]
}
```

Both examples above are equivalent and will not cause a validation error.

## Data validation

When your data is merged, the __Check data and create pr__ action will run on the repository *Actions* page automatically.
This action validates your files and loads them into the TradingView storage.

You can also run the __Check data and create pr__ action manually by clicking __Run workflow__ button on the repository *Actions* tab with selected __Check data and create pr__ action.
Running action manually can be used when the automatic run fails for some external reason (e.g., GitHub is down, temporary problem with the runner occurred).

Before merging your data, ensure that your files and their content follow the requirements described in this article.
Otherwise, you will get errors in the *Actions* page logs.

## Data repository access

Your repository can only be private.

## Get access to a repository

1. Send us an email to pine.seeds@tradingview.com with the subject __Pine Seeds Request__.
    Specify your GitHub username and the desired repository suffix. __The maximum number of characters in suffix must be 16.__
    Repository name will be `seed_<your_github_username>_<suffix_you_provided>`.
    Note that your username and suffix will be used as [parts](README.md#Example) of the unique prefix for your data.
2. Wait for a link to the repository.

## Fork the repository

1. Go to GitHub _Settings → Password and authentication_ and configure [two-factor authentication][2fa].
2. Go to GitHub _Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic) → Generate new token → Generate new token (classic)_. Create _Personal access token_ for __repo__, __workflow__, and __admin:org__ areas.

# Pine Seeds documentation

## Overview

__Pine Seeds__ is a service to import your custom data and access it via [TradingView](https://tradingview.com).

This service allows you to:

- connect your series data to TradingView
- open it on the TradingView chart
- use it in custom indicators

Use [TradingView](https://tradingview.com) as your __frontend__ and use a GitHub repository as your __backend__. 

Keep in mind that such data (we call them EOD data, short for End-of-Day) has certain limitations:

- the data can only be updated a few times per day
- only daily-based timeframes (1D and above) can be applied to such data
- the number of data elements (symbols) is [limited][data_limits] to 1000
- such data [will not appear][ui_symbol_search] in the symbol search box

> __Note__
> 
> Read our [5-minute tutorial](tutorial.md) to get started right now

Setting up the service includes several steps:

- [data preparation][data]
- setting up a [repository][repo]
- manipulating data in the [TradingView UI][ui]

## Example

You just need to set up the repository, upload your data to it and wait for it to be uploaded to the TradingView platform.

`SEED_CRYPTO_SANTIMENT:BTC_DEV_ACTIVITY` is an example of custom data integration. You can work with it on your Chart.

The symbol name is uniquely determined by Github settings.

- `SEED` is a mandatory prefix for this type of data
- `CRYPTO` is the name of the `github.com/crypto` GitHub account
- `SANTIMENT` is the suffix for repository name `github.com/crypto/seed_crypto_santiment` you provided
- `BTC_DEV_ACTIVITY` is a data filename `BTC_DEV_ACTIVITY.CSV`

Now, using the built-in [request.seed()][pine_refs] function from the [Pine Scriptâ„¢ language][pine_docs] and the available data, you can build a chart.

```js
//@version=5
indicator("BTC Dev Activity", format=format.volume)
//request.seed(source, repo_name, symbol, expression[, gaps])
activity = request.seed("crypto", "santiment", "BTC_DEV_ACTIVITY", close)
plot(activity, "BTC Dev Activity")
```

By adding Bitcoin developer activity data from the EOD source (_SEED_CRYPTO_SANTIMENT:BTC_DEV_ACTIVITY_) to the _BTCUSD_ chart, you will receive additional information for technical analysis.
